  * N-N, N-1, N-N-N relation-ships which needs an simple extension only for N-N-N.
  * Inifile management with forms auto-save and auto-width. TOnFormInfoIni can save a lot of values of visual components ([Video](http://youtu.be/jcxrgjsmfOc))
  * DB colors
  * DB images with JPEG, PNG, BMP, etc.
  * DB Numeric and Spin Edit
  * DB Listview loaded parts by parts
  * DB Images and Imagelists
