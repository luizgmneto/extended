# Project History #

The packages Extended and Man Frames have been created in Microcelt Rennes to create management softwares. There were 2 objectives in the original package. Before sharing them, Matthieu Giroux has reviewed them to to separate projects and components. I have preferred to work with a lot of free components. It has only be reviewed for Lazarus only components.

TFormDico was fat. It could not support a lot of tables. It has been reviewed to create TFW controls and a lot of Forms. I have created also Sources' Columns and Man Frames. Using Lazarus components is a new feature of Old Commercial Project. Fortes is an extension for Ancestromania. Using Imaging and BGRA Bitmap is also a new feature For Ancestromania. I search to upgrade Extended also with W4 Express and XML Frames.
